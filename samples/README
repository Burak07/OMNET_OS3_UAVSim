This directory contains several simulation models to demonstrate the features of the UAVSim simulation framework. 

The source code for all models are provided for you to study. While we have done our best to comment the sources, it is probably necessary to browse
through the Manual before you try to understand them. You might also find the simulation kernel API reference useful.
